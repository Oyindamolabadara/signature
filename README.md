## **About**

The Signature website is a full-stack e-commerce project built for a fictional jewellery store. It is a B2C e-commerce website that provides role-based permissions for users to interact with a central dataset. It includes user authentication, email validation, and full CRUD functionality for approved users for Products, Categories, Blog Posts and Reviews. N.B. This project is for educational purposes only.

## **Wireframes**

* Wireframes were not created for confirmation pages, to avoid duplicating similar pages. 

* Due to time and deadline constraints, I had to take out the men's, collections; deals, clearance items and special offers categories from the site.

## **Web Marketing**

### **Newsletter**

A newsletter subscription was created using Mailchimp for email marketing. 
![Mailchimp Subscription](media/readme_images/mailchimp_image.png)

### **Facebook**

[A dummy Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089994846073) was set up as a means of social media marketing to interact with customers and promote products and services. 

I had to use Signature_unoffical as the page name because using "Signature" was invalid. 

![Facebook Image 1](media/readme_images/facebook_page_one.png)

![Facebook Image 2](media/readme_images/facebook_page_two.png)

## **Search Engine Optimization**

Based on my google search, the following relevant keywords were used for this project;
The Best Places To Find Jewellery, Engagement Rings, Jewellery Gifts, Quality Jewellery, Gifts for Her, Gifts for Women, Signature Jewellery, Jewellery shop near me, Jewellery Sale, Jewellery for Women, Gold Necklace, Gold Earrings, Silver Necklace, Silver Earrings

The site has been equipped with a sitemap generated [here](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) and robots.txt. 

The site also has a privacy policy generated [here](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/).

### **Structure**

The structure of this website was built using CI Boutique Ado Walkthrough Project, which contains the following apps; Home, Products, Profile, Bag and Checkout. The review, blog and company info app were created outside of the walkthrough project. 

### **Inspiration**

During the planning process, I went through a jewellery store, [Zudo](https://uk.zudo.co/) where I shop from. 
Asides the Boutique Ado Walkthrough, I also found two of CI’s students’ projects inspiring and helpful throughout the project; [Kat632’s Watch You Want?](https://github.com/Kat632/watchyouwant#readme) and [SamanthaBooth81’s clay_and_fire](https://github.com/SamanthaBooth81/clay_and_fire#readme)

### **Colour and Theme**

The theme for this website was inspired by the landing page image. The [Adobe Express free custom colour palette creator](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) was used to generate palettes with colour combinations used for the website. 

![Adobe Colour and Theme](media/readme_images/adobe_colour.png)

### **Font**

I choose the Inter and Roboto Slab fonts, as they both maintain great readability and are versatile.

* Go to the bucket policy tab and select policy generator to create a security policy for this bucket. The policy type is going to be s3 bucket policy and then allow all principals by using a '*' and the action will be, get object. Copy the ARN which stands for Amazon resource Name from the other tab and paste it into the ARN box at the bottom. Click 'Add statement' and then 'Generate Policy'.

* Connect Django to the new S3 bucket. To do this, install two new packages; boto3 and django-storages.
* Freeze these to the requirements.txt file.
* To connect Django to S3 (only on Heroku), add the following in settings.py:


        if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
            # Cache control
            AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
                'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
                'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
            }

            # Bucket Config
            AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'oyindamolabadara-signature'
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
            AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com'


* Go to heroku to set up enviromental variables, open CSV file downloaded earlier and copy each variable into heroku settings; AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME,  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from csv, USE_AWS = True and remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from heroku.
* Create file in root directory custom_storages.py

        from django.conf import settings
        from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


        class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
            location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


        class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
            location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

* Go to settings.py, add the AWS settings
        # Static and media files
        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
        STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
        MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

        # Override static and media URLs in production
        STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
        MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

* To load the media files to S3 bucket, go to the S3 bucket page on AWS, create new folder "media" and click upload.

Bug: django secret key 
8. Following setting up the database I generated a new Secret Key, to replace the insecure key that was in settings.py and added: os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY'). I then added the newly generated key to the Config Vars on Heroku.

- [ ] CSS not loading on browser, even after hard refresh. I checked on the slack channel and found similar issues. It was solved by clearing my browser cache on chrome.
