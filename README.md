## **About**

The Signature website is a full-stack e-commerce project built for a fictional jewellery store. It is a B2C e-commerce website that provides role-based permissions for users to interact with a central dataset. It includes user authentication, email validation, and full CRUD functionality for approved users for Products, Categories, Blog Posts and Reviews. N.B. This project is for educational purposes only.

## **Wireframes**

* Wireframes were not created for confirmation pages, to avoid duplicating similar pages. 

* Due to time and deadline constraints, I had to take out the men's, collections; deals, clearance items and special offers categories from the site.
